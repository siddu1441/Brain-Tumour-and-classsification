This project aims to elaborate the research and application of
deep learning algorithms for the classification of seizures and
any other abnormal brain activities in patients under critical condition from EEG scans and recordings. Classical reading of
EEG still images is labor intensive and subjective which
inhibits appropriate interventions when necessary. Employing
neural networks in the system promotes the detection and
classification of harmful patterns that in turn promotes the
accurate, timely and efficient decision support. The use of advanced pre-processing and feature extraction methods enables the model to perform adequately on both sensitivity
and specificity.
